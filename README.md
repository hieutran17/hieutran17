## Hi, I'm Hieu 👋

I'm a full-stack engineer building workflow automation and internal tools for businesses.
Most of my production experience comes from developing on an in-house platform (custom framework) with PHP/MySQL and JavaScript.

### What I do
- Build workflow / service flow products (blocks, execution, permissions, audit logs)
- Design and implement REST APIs and complex business logic
- Work end-to-end: backend + web UI + debugging + deployment support

### Tech I use
- Backend: PHP (in-house framework), Laravel (learning / portfolio)
- Frontend: JavaScript, jQuery (production), React (learning / portfolio)
- Database: MySQL
- Tooling: Git, Docker, CI basics

### Current focus
- Building a public portfolio: **Workflow Automation API** (Laravel)  
- Looking for **remote part-time** opportunities (10–20h/week)
