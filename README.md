## Hi, I'm Hieu 👋

I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in workflow automation and internal tools for small teams and startups.
Most of my production experience comes from developing on an in-house platform (custom framework) with PHP/MySQL and JavaScript.

### What I do
- Build workflow / service flow systems (execution engine, permissions, audit logs, business logic)
- Design and implement REST APIs and complex business logic
- Work end-to-end: backend + web UI + debugging + deployment support

### Tech I use
- Backend: PHP (in-house framework), Laravel (learning / portfolio)
- Frontend: JavaScript, jQuery (production), React (learning / portfolio)
- Database: MySQL
- Tooling: Git, Docker, CI basics

### Current focus
- Building a public Workflow Automation API (Laravel) to demonstrate production-level backend design.
- Looking for **remote part-time** opportunities (10–20h/week)
